        <h1>MY PROJECTS</h1>
        <p>Following are the projects undertaken by me:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;">
            <li>
                <p style="word-wrap: normal;">STUDENT REPORT CARD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:<br>
                    This project was designed by me in 2019 after completion of my course in C++ programming. This project included the concepts
                    of OOPS and file handling.

                <p style="word-wrap: normal;">DIABETES PREDICTION SYSTEM USING MACHINE LEARNING IN PYTHON:<br>
                    This project was designed by me in 2021 as a group project, which was a part of our curriculum in 6th Semester. This project was 
                    designed using Scikit-Learn library in Python language. This system works by comparing four separate machine learning algorithms,
                     namely <b>Linear Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest and KNN.</b> It then computes the best performing model, and 
                     uses it to compute the risk of diabetes for the user as per the data input given by the user.
                </p>

            <li>
                <p style="word-wrap: normal;">TIME TABLE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:<br>
                    This project was designed by me in 2021 as a group project, which was a part of our curriculum in 6th semester. This project implements 
                    the concepts of web development using HTML, CSS, and PHP. The entire system was linked with a SQL database, completely developed over Wamp server.
                     The system took input of registered members, and displayed their time tables. Additionally, it had the functionality of adding new classes to
                      the schedule, for faculty users of the system.

                <p style="word-wrap: normal;">GREEN SCREEN IMPLEMENTATION:<br>
                    This project was designed by me in 2021 while studying web development from Coursera. This system uses the Canvas element 
                    to take input of an image, having a green screen as its background. It then replaces all green pixels with the pixels of the 
                    image, which will act as the background of the previous image. Thus it works to implement the green screen algorithm on images.

            <li>
                <p style="word-wrap: normal;">IMAGE FILTER APPLICATION SYSTEM:<br>
                    This project was designed by me in 2021 while studying web development from Coursera. This system uses the Canvas element 
                    to take input of an image, and then works on the pixels of the image to apply various filters on the image, namely 
                    <b>Grayscale, Red Filter, and Rainbow filter.</b>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p style="word-wrap: normal;">MEASUREMENT UNIT CONVERSION SYSTEM:<br>
                    This project was designed by me in 2021 while studying PHP. This is designed using PHP language and works to convert various 
                    measurement units.
